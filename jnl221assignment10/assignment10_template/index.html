      <h1>Standardized Testing and Its Achievement Gap</h1>
      <p>Standardized testing is one factor of the college admission process. Do these test scores allow students to show off their intellect or their socio-economic status? </p>

    <p>Standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, give students across the nation the same questions in the same manner, graded the same way. However, not every student is given the same educational opportunities to prepare for these exams. </p>
    <p>Predictors for how students will score on these tests can often be attributed to their access to educational opportunities, their parents’ education and income levels, and their ability to afford tutors and test preparation materials rather than natural intellect.
    </p>
    <p>For both the ACT and SAT, the majority of students who took these tests in 2023 identified as white. This group of students also scored higher on both exams compared to minority groups, excluding Asian students who performed the best out of all racial groups. This large difference is a result of the achievement gap phenomena. </p>
    <p>According to the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/studies/gaps/">National Assessment of Educational Process</a>, an achievement gap occurs when a group of students outperforms another group in testing and the average scores are significantly different.</p>


    <p>Factors that create these gaps in education include societal stigma, income levels, employment rate, access to education, neighborhood crime rate, and more.

    <p>For example, students of lower income levels tend to reflect a lower standardized test score. Some students lack the funds for tutors, multiple attempts to take the test, and other academic support methods than their wealthier peers can obtain. 
    </p>
    <p>This educational inequity is ingrained within school systems as predominantly white communities have better funding and resources compared to marginalized communities.
    </p>
    <p>“The underrepresented areas and ethnicities, like Black and Hispanic, don't have the funding within those schools,” said <a href="https://newhouse.syracuse.edu/people/wesley-whiteside">Newhouse Associate Director of Recruitment and Diversity Wes Whiteside.</a> “That takes away from what they were learning and what they were being taught, so they're kind of far behind academically.”
    </p>
    <p>Requiring standardized test scores used to be the norm for most colleges and universities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most schools waived the requirement of test scores for admissions and are continuing this policy years later.  </p>
    <p>This new-wave of test optional and free policies among colleges can help preserve diversity in a post-affirmative action college admission landscape.
      </p>
      <p>  In a 2023 court case, the Supreme Court ruled race-conscious college admissions unconstitutional, which eliminated the use of affirmative action within the college admission process.</p>

      <p> "I was not thrilled about the decision," said Whiteside. "When you're looking at universities, and you're saying you want to be diverse and want to bring in kids from underrepresented areas and underrepresented cultures, to take that away from them to identify themselves in those areas, I thought it was a little bit of a detriment to that.""
      </p>
      <p> 
        Syracuse University’s test optional policy was first established in 2021. Announced early April, Syracuse University extended its test optional policy for students applying for Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 admissions.

<p>In a <a href="https://news.syr.edu/blog/2024/04/03/syracuse-university-extends-test-optional-policy-for-students-applying-for-fall-2025-admission/">Syracuse University news update</a>, Maurice A. Harris, dean of admissions, said, “As a result of the test optional policy, we place greater emphasis on other components of the student’s journey, including academic performance, the rigor of their chosen courses and extracurricular engagement.”</p>




      <p>Without the pressure of getting a certain score on standardized testing, students can have a weight lifted off their back within the college admission process. For Syracuse and other test optional/free schools, students can prioritize other aspects of their application that showcase their other abilities. 
      </p>

      <p>“I was happy that we made the decision to go test optional,” said Whiteside. “I think that really helped increase our numbers of our students of color.”
